    Purpose:
        This is an interactive website containing a relational database of sacred music (choral and organ) by composers whose
        identities are demographically underrepresented in the canon of Western classical music.  Its purpose is to provide 
        church musicians with information about well-written music that would be appropriate for use during the church year.

    <p>Welcome to A Great Cloud of Witnesses.  This is a relational database of sacred music (choral and 
        organ) by composers whose identities are demographically underrepresented in the canon of Western 
        classical music.  Its purpose is to provide church musicians with information about well-written 
        music that would be appropriate for use during the church year.

<h3>Searching the Great Cloud of Witnesses</h3>
    <p>
        Searching this database can be done via the search page.  You may search for music in a number of 
        ways.  Common searches include searching by season, by composer, by title, or by voicing.  You may 
        also search for music based on the identity of a composer.  For example, in programming music for a 
        service uplifting the voices of Asian composers of sacred music, you may want to search for music by 
        Asian composers.  Similarly, if you are looking to program Anglican chant by queer composers for the 
        duration of Pride month, you may want to search for those settings specifically.
