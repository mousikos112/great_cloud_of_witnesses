    Purpose:
        This is an interactive website containing a relational database of sacred music (choral and organ) by composers whose
        identities are demographically underrepresented in the canon of Western classical music.  Its purpose is to provide 
        church musicians with information about well-written music that would be appropriate for use during the church year.
